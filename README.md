This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict stock prices using historical market data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature analysis, model training, and performance evaluation.

The dataset is processed and split into training and testing sets. A regression model is trained to learn patterns in historical price movements and evaluated using metrics such as R², MAE, and RMSE to assess predictive performance and generalization ability.

The project is structured into modular scripts:
	•	DataProcessing.py – Data cleaning and feature preparation
	•	Train.py – Model training and saving
	•	Test.py – Model evaluation on unseen data
	•	STATISTICS.py – Statistical and correlation analysis

This repository demonstrates practical implementation of supervised learning techniques, model evaluation, and structured ML project organization in Python using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
